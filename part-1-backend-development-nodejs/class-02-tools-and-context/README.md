===

## Daily Plan
* Note: Please don't change any files in the root of the lab directories, other than adding your own lab dir.
* Graduation period... start thinking about timing
* Review lab01 briefly
* Try/Catch & Pass by ref / Pass by val...


## package.json Resources
* Read [about package.json]

## NPM Script Resources
* Skim [npm scripts as build tools]
* Skim [npm scripts docs]

# Context resources
* Read [MDN this]
* Watch the Video [Javascript Context Tutorial]

# Prototype resources
* Skim [MDN new]
* Skim [MDN Object prototype]
* Read [MDN inheritance and the prototype chain]

## Error Resources
* Read [node Error docs]

## Learning Objectives
<!-- unordered list of learning objectives -->
* understand the difference between context and scope
* learn how to configure a functions context
* understand the roll context plays in constructor functions

## Overview
#### package.json
* a package.json is a config file used for configuring metadata about a node project
* It only requires a name and version filed, but a typical package.json has much more information
* dependencies vs dev-dependencies
 * dependencies - a list of packages required to run the main program
 * dev-dependencies - a list of packages required to work on the project
* npm scripts are used to manage common tasks for working a node project  
* Setting up a project
 * create a new directory named after your project
 * navigate inside your directory
 * run `npm init` and answer the questions
 * now you should find a package.json inside your current directory :)

#### Gulp (just fyi)
* Gulp is a tool that helps you automate time-consuming tasks that are a part of your dev workflow
* Gulp is configured in pure javascript, so you can use any node module in a gulp task
* Gulp has a awesome plugin ecosystem

#### Node Errors
###### Error
* a generic error
* `.stack` - a **String** describe the point in the code where the `Error` was instantiated
* `.message` - a **String** description set by calling the `new Error(message)`  

###### ReferenceError
* indicates that an attempt is being made to access a variable that is not defined
* `ReferenceError` is a subclass of `Error`  

###### SyntaxError
* indicates a program is not valid javascript
* `SyntaxError` is a subclass of `Error`  

###### TypeError
* indicates that a provided argument is not an allowable type
* `TypeError` is a subclass of `Error`    

###### SystemError
* `.code` - A **String** describing the error code
* `.errno` - A **Number** describing the error code
* `.syscall` - A **String** describing the syscall that failed
* `SystemError` is **not** a subclass of `Error`
* Common System Errors
 * `EACCESS` - An attempt to access a file without the right permissions
 * `EADDRINUSE` - An attempt to start a server on a PORT that is already in use
 * `ECONNREFUSED` - A connection was deliberately refused by the target machine
 * `ECONNRESET` - A connection was forcibly closed by a peer
 * `EEXIST` - A file exists and the attempted action required that it didn't
 * `EISDIR` - An action expected to act on a file but found a directory
 * `EMFILE` - To many files were open for your operating system to handle
 * `ENOENT` - An action expected a file, but did not find one
 * `ENOTDIR` - An action expected a directory, but found something else
 * `ENOTEMPTY` - An action expected an empty directory, but found one with data in it
 * `EPERM` - An attempt to do something that you currently don't have permissions to do
 * `EPIPE` - An attempt to write data to a connection that had been closed

###### Throw Try Catch
* If an un handled error is thrown in javascript the program will crash
* try catch blocks allow you to safely throw a an error and handle it

<!-- ### Pass by reference vs Pass by value
*
* -->

### Call, Bind, Apply
* when a function has a `this` we say that `this` is the functions context
* unlike scope a functions context can be configured
* If a function is not a property on an object, by default it has no context
* If a function is a property on an object, by default that object is the context for that function
* `call`, `bind`, and `apply` are function prototype methods that allow us to change the context of a function
* `call` is a methods on a function that invokes a function with a specified context and arguments  
 * `call` passes comma separated arguments
* `apply` is a methods on a function that invokes a function with a specified context and arguments  
 * `apply` passes arguments from an array  
* don't mess with `__proto__` its slow **not even to read a property**
* if you want to determine an objects prototype use `Object.getPrototypeOf(someObject)`
* don't nest a lot of prototype's it will have a speed impact on your code
* if you look up a property that is not on any object on the prototype chain it will still look through the whole prototype chain
